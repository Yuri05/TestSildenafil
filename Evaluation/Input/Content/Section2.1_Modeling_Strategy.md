The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([Willmann 2007](#5-references)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.


First, a mean model was built using clinical data from single dose studies with intravenous and oral administration of sildenafil by Muirhead et al. 2002 ([Muirhead 2002a](#5-references)), Nichols et al. 2002 ([Nichols 2002](#5-references)), the FDA 2009 ([FDA 2009](#5-references)), and Walker et al. 1999 ([Walker 1999](#5-references)). The mean PBPK model was developed using a typical male European individual. The relative tissue-specific expressions of enzymes predominantly being involved in the metabolism of sildenafil (CYP3A4) were considered ([Meyer 2012](#5-references)).

A specific selected set of parameters (see below) was optimized using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim®. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility.

Once the appropriate structural model was identified, a Weibull function was fitted using R 4.2.1 based on in vitro data ([Sawatdee 2019](#5-references)), and the resulting dissolution kinetic parameters were implemented in the model.

The model was then evaluated by simulating further clinical studies reporting pharmacokinetic concentration-time profiles of sildenafil.

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#22-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).
